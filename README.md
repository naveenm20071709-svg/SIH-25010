## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

<!-- Proposed Solution -->
## Proposed Solution

<ul>
  <li>Multilingual AI-powered mobile app + chatbot delivering real-time, location-specific agricultural advisory.</li>
  <li>Key features:
    <ul>
      <li>Crop advisory: season- and location-specific crop recommendations.</li>
      <li>Soil health & fertilizer guidance based on soil tests and farmer inputs.</li>
      <li>Weather-driven alerts and predictive insights (rainfall, heat, frost, storms).</li>
      <li>Pest & disease detection via image uploads and AI-driven classification.</li>
      <li>Market price tracking for local mandi and nearby markets.</li>
      <li>Voice support and vernacular UI for low-literate users.</li>
      <li>Feedback loop and telemetry for continuous model improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why it works: combines AI, local data (soil/weather/market), and voice/vernacular accessibility to reduce guesswork and improve decision making.</li>
  <li>Innovation: unified platform that merges image-based diagnostics, localized predictive analytics, multilingual voice interaction, and market intelligence tailored for small & marginal farmers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Technical Approach -->
## Technical Approach

<ul>
  <li>Technologies:
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend: Flutter or React Native (cross-platform mobile).</li>
      <li>Backend: Node.js or Django REST API.</li>
      <li>AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest/disease image models and PyTorch/TensorFlow or Hugging Face tools for multilingual NLP.</li>
      <li>Database: PostgreSQL for relational data; a time-series DB or Firebase for real-time updates.</li>
      <li>Cloud: AWS / GCP / Azure for model hosting, storage and scaling.</li>
      <li>External Data: IMD / Government APIs for weather; local mandi/market price APIs or scrapers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implementation methodology (high level):
    <ul>
      <li>Phase 1 — Data & partnerships: collect soil maps, weather feeds, historical crop data, and market price sources; partner with KVKs/NGOs for field data.</li>
      <li>Phase 2 — Model development: train pest/disease image classifiers, yield and weather-risk models, and multilingual voice/NLP agents for local languages.</li>
      <li>Phase 3 — App & chatbot build: create simple UI with voice-first flows, offline-first capabilities, and SMS fallback.</li>
      <li>Phase 4 — Pilot: deploy in selected districts of Punjab, collect feedback and telemetry.</li>
      <li>Phase 5 — Scale: expand regionally, integrate more crops, and onboard extension officers and cooperatives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deliverables: working mobile app + chatbot, model API endpoints, pilot report, training materials, and monitoring dashboard.</li>
  <li>Note: Flow charts, UI mockups, and prototypes can be created as separate visual assets for presentations.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Feasibility and Viability -->
## Feasibility and Viability

<ul>
  <li>Feasibility:
    <ul>
      <li>High smartphone penetration in rural India supports mobile delivery.</li>
      <li>Existing public datasets (soil, weather, mandi prices) enable cost-effective integration.</li>
      <li>Proven ML techniques exist for image-based pest/disease detection and multilingual NLP/voice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Potential challenges & risks:
    <ul>
      <li>Low digital literacy and trust barriers among farmers.</li>
      <li>Intermittent internet connectivity in remote areas.</li>
      <li>Data quality gaps (noisy or sparse local datasets for some crops/regions).</li>
      <li>Regulatory / privacy concerns when collecting farmer and farm data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mitigation strategies:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide voice-first UX, SMS fallback, and offline caching for critical advisories.</li>
      <li>Run farmer training workshops with KVKs, cooperatives, and NGOs to build trust and teach app usage.</li>
      <li>Start with a focused pilot (few crops, a few districts) to improve data quality before scaling.</li>
      <li>Adopt clear data-privacy policies, opt-in consent flows, and anonymize telemetry.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Business viability:
    <ul>
      <li>Initial funding via government grants (Government of Punjab) and public–private partnerships.</li>
      <li>Revenue paths: premium analytics, market-linkage fees, agritech integrations, and partnerships with input suppliers (carefully managed to avoid conflicts of interest).</li>
